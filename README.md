Things I've learnt whilst going through this project:

* Wednesday 16th November 2016
Today I completed chapter 6 of Hartl's book and added this through (slightly adjusting along the way for personal project reasons) and after struggling with the entire concept of the MVC and layout of apps, it's all starting to come together. Changes to the model and controller create no aesthetic changes that are viewable outside of the source code (obviously lol), what strikes me about this is the way a back end could effectively be completely built, refactored and engineered, yet the face of the site would not show any improvement at all (at least in the case of the model, controller would add more pages). Throughout the chapter I was struck by how useful even very basic implementations of gems (bcrypt in this example) could be, with the use of has_secure_password inside my user.rb model (below my other validation criteria) I was able to call up a massive variety of methods and other useful bits and pieces.

Should have made entries on previous days but you know, shoot me. Project is going well, encountered a small hiccough yesterday when I found a small bug but perhaps got a bit impulsive in my hunt for it and made some stupid changes in places that I should not have touched, slightly demotivating to be fair, not know if the commit you're now on is written correctly, I understand there are probably easy ways of fixing this but I'm still at the start of my Git experience so I'll learn them as I go. I basically rolled back a big set of commits (to the start of the branch) in order to find what turned out to be a small typo. Annoying. I recently recieved Agile Web Development with Rails 5 in the mail and have been blown away at how well written both this book and (from a place of little to no experience actually with code) the code of Rails 5 itself, things are used to seem cryptic as fuck have now been illuminated. I am surpised by how intuitive a lot of the code writes, even for some pretty deep topics. Will write more today as I plan to have a good go of it.
